# today I will be writing notes then attempting the towards data science neural network in python
then I will attempt to use that knowledge for my own neural network

Steps
1. Feed input into Neural Network
2. Data flow from layer to layer until output
3. Calculate error (scalar) from output
4. Adjust given parameter (weight or bias) by subtracting derivative of error with respect to parameter
itself
5. Iterate

The Neural Network we will be doing today is forward propagation, this is where the output of one
layer is the input of the next layer.

We will use gradient descent to reduce error each iteration w=w-alpha(dE/dw)

I dont understand the chain rule math here:

1. Implementation

2. Base Layer

3. Dense Layer

4. Activation Layer

5. Implement activiation functions and loss functions

6. Solve XOR

ML Steps
