Why do I want to pursue a master in data science? 
I love engineering, I love robotics, I love rockets, and I think data science is the perfect tool to 
assist me as an engineer in todays digital world. One of the most impactful expierences I've had in
my life was when I got the oppurtunity to work at the San Diego Super Computer Center in the Wildfire
Prevention Program. It was a program where our team was tasked with figuring out a way to assist
firefighters in creating a plan to extuinguish fires in an efficient and safe way. There is only
so much water and so many brave firefighters that can put their life on the line to put out a fire.
The way our team could assist them is manipulating data already avaible to create a real time model
of fires as they occur. Using vegetation data, humidity, local weather radars, recent rainfall, and
previous fires burn time, the machine learning model was able to predict the permeter of a fire with
repect to time as soon as the fire started. {insert some more on how the data worked}. I found it super
impactful that I got to use such a complex model and work with such incredible people that were working
towards solving a problem that destroys so many lives. This expierence ingrained the use of machine learning
and data-driven solutions as an incredible tool in my head. The next expierence I had where I took some of
the lessons I learned from the wildifre modeling job was when I worked with a head and neck surgeon from 
the UCSD medical school on a device to support her patients muscular distrophy. The patient had artificial
nerves installed post surgery that restricted them from creating a seal with their mouth. This was a problem
because the patient was a muscisian and they loved to play the saxophone. I used a 3D scanner to scan the contours
of the patients face. I designed a mouth piece using solidworks and I ran finite element analysis simulations
to make sure it supported his face. And then I prototyped it using 3D printers and tested 37 different iterations
on the patient until I reached a prototype that worked.

What is your expeirence with data structures, linear algebra, python?
My expierence with data structures has been mostly through online courses through coursera and EdX. I've been
able to gain expierence using binary search, recursion, search trees, and hash tables. I've had a little
bit of expierence using SQL to store data in tables and retrieve it. I've had a lot of expierence using anayltical
reasoning in my alculus and Matlab programming through my mechanical engineering undergradaute. I used matlab a lot in both
my rocket club, to predict and model velocity loss through pipes, and in my classes for projects like modeling the
navier stokes equations for a particle emitted from a rocket engine. Most of the Matlab projects involved
recursive structures, many embedded loops, matrix multiplication and dot products, and objects oriented programming becuase 
a lot of the physics equations had to be written in their own functions and then called back in different scenerios.

Why pick Berkeley?
My goal right now is to maximize my learning potentional so that I can use this powerful tool in the enginseering
world to assist my projects and better informed decisions for the systems that I manage. I really love the part of your program
where classes are sychronous, most classes have group projects, and there are small classes where students 
really get to know each other. I love learning with people that have different perspectives than me, and Berkeley
attracts exceptionally diverse and incredibly smart students from around the globe and I would love to be apart of that.
Additionally, I really look forward to taking the captstone class and the machine learning at scale class because 
doing projects is my job and what I want to continue to do and implementing machine learning into my projects
would be my ultimate goal.
